Automatically sends a message and DMs any users added to the ticket before the closure date. Will DM any users added to the ticket when it is closed automatically. Improved Purge Command Our new purge command allows for all types of users.

Ben: All features + Bug fixes Wyvern Testers: Testing v1.3.1 Ticket Update (Week One Patch) - 01/10/21 Following feedback from v1.3.0 , we have released a patch to fix some bugs that slipped under our radar, and a few small features. Features There is now a button under missing permission warnings to disable future warnings if you are already aware of the problem and do not wish to fix it. Unique error codes are now generated and sent with errors. If you encounter any problems using Wyvern, you can open a ticket and send us this error code for possible fixes. Added vote cooldowns to the vote message (tells you when you can next vote on each platform) Permission restrictions - we are committed to making Wyvern as easy as possible to use. Now, when you try to run a command that Wyvern does not have sufficient permissions to execute, the bot will provide you with the permissions it needs. Additions Fixed vote messages showing times from the previous vote The levelling module will remain on for new servers, however there is a new option called levellingMessages which will now be turned off by default Added alias 'votes' to the vote command Fixed punishment commands responding twice with different errors Fixed the report command not sending reports properly The bot must now have the SEND_MESSAGES and READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY permissions for any aspect of it to function in a channel.

Here's a list of all the current sites you can vote on: Top.gg Discord Labs Discord Boats Discord Bot List Discords.com Infinity Bot List You don't have to vote on all of them! Tip Use !vote to view more personal information, such as when your Benefits Session and current streak will expire! What's in it for me? When you vote for Wyvern, we will award you with the following benefits: Up to 25% extra levelling XP A voters role in the Wyvern Support Discord server A voters badge on the profile command What's in it for you? By voting for us, the bot listing sites we are currently on will recommend our bot to more users. Leaderboard Our vote leaderboard is sorted by the number of votes in your Benefits Session . You can view the leaderboard by executing the command !vote position . This command will show you the number of votes the person above and below you has, but it will not display their name. Here's an example of the command output: At the end of each month, people in positions #1-#3 may be eligible for a prize. In a normal month, all 3 will be given premium to give use in their own server. Prizes and those eligible for them may vary from month to month. Benefits Session To obtain a place on our Vote Leaderboard and gain a greater levelling XP boost, you need to maintain your voting benefits (your Benefits Session). Each vote will give up to 6 hours of benefits, and you are able to vote on each of our 6 sites every 12 hours. Theoretically, this means you can send 12 votes in a day, and therefore gain up to 72 hours of benefits in one day! Warning If you do not vote and let your benefits expire, your benefits' session will end, meaning you will lose the following: Your vote streak The Number of votes in this session All benefits you had in this session Don't panic! You can continue to vote if your benefits' session expires. This also means that if you choose to build up a high benefit duration, you are essentially creating yourself a 'safety net', in case you forget to vote some days. Don't worry though; Wyvern will send you a reminder when you can vote on all 6 sites again. Levelling XP benefit You may have noticed the 'up to 25%' on the levelling XP benefit. This is because it will increase the longer your streak is. See below for the extra XP brackets: Minimum days to quality for bracket Extra XP 0 days 5% 5 days 10% 10 days 15% 15 days 20% 20 days 25% (these do not stack) We understand that it can be hard for some people to keep a streak, but we felt this was the only fair way to give extra levelling XP whilst keeping it as balanced as possible.","title":"Voting (free)"},{"location":"support-us/vote/#voting-for-wyvern","text":"Voting is an incredibly easy way for you to support Wyvern for completely free.
