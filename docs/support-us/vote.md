#Voting for Wyvern
Voting is an incredibly easy way for you to support Wyvern for completely free. Here's a list of all the current sites
you can vote on:

* [Top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/845214061511180298/vote)
* [Discord Labs](https://bots.discordlabs.org/bot/845214061511180298)
* [Discord Boats](https://discord.boats/bot/845214061511180298/vote)
* [Discord Bot List](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/wyvern/upvote)
* [Discords.com](https://discords.com/bots/bot/845214061511180298/vote)
* [Infinity Bot List](https://infinitybotlist.com/bots/845214061511180298/vote)

<sub>You don't have to vote on all of them!</sub>

!!! tip 
    Use `!vote` to view more personal information, such as when your [Benefits Session](#benefits-session) and current 
    streak will expire!

##What's in it for me?
When you vote for Wyvern, we will award you with the following benefits:

* Up to 25% extra levelling XP
* A voters role in the Wyvern Support Discord server
* A voters badge on the profile command

##What's in it for you?
By voting for us, the bot listing sites we are currently on will recommend our bot to more users. 

##Leaderboard
Our vote leaderboard is sorted by the number of votes in your [Benefits Session](#benefits-session). You can view the
leaderboard by executing the command `!vote position`. This command will show you the number of votes the person above
and below you has, but it will not display their name. Here's an example of the command output:

![Vote Leaderboard Example](../assets/vote-lb-example.png "An example output of the leaderboard command (not real data!)")


At the end of each month, people in positions #1-#3 may be eligible for a prize. In a normal month, all 3 will be given
[premium](premium.md) to give use in their own server. Prizes and those eligible for them may vary from month to month.

##Benefits Session
To obtain a place on our [Vote Leaderboard](#leaderboard) and gain a greater levelling XP boost, you need to maintain
your voting benefits (your Benefits Session). Each vote will give up to 6 hours of benefits, and you are able to vote on each of our 6 sites
every 12 hours. Theoretically, this means you can send 12 votes in a day, and therefore gain up to 72 hours of benefits
in one day! 

!!! warning 
    If you do not vote and let your benefits expire, your benefits' session will end, meaning you will lose the following:

    * Your vote streak
    * The Number of votes in this session
    * All benefits you had in this session

    Don't panic! You can continue to vote if your benefits' session expires.

This also means that if you choose to build up a high benefit duration, you are essentially creating yourself a 'safety
net', in case you forget to vote some days. Don't worry though; Wyvern will send you a reminder when you can vote on
all 6 sites again.

##Levelling XP benefit
You may have noticed the 'up to 25%' on the levelling XP benefit. This is because it will increase the longer your 
streak is. See below for the extra XP brackets:

| Minimum days to quality for bracket | Extra XP |
|-------------------------------------|----------|
| 0 days                              | 5%       |
| 5 days                              | 10%      |
| 10 days                             | 15%      |
| 15 days                             | 20%      |
| 20 days                             | 25%      |

<sub>*(these do not stack)*</sub>

We understand that it can be hard for some people to keep a streak, but we felt this was the only fair way to give extra
levelling XP whilst keeping it as balanced as possible.
