#Support - Remote
Wyvern is currently hiring support operators to assist our users in using our services and answering any inquiries they
may have.

##Responsibilities
You'll be providing support to people who are having difficulty with bot arguments and setting up the bot. They may 
also wish to report bugs or suggest features, in which case you can leave the ticket to the development team. 
This is a relatively low skill level position, no hands-on training will be provided; information however is available 
in the applicable channels and other support representatives will be happy to help. If you wish to gain background
knowledge to better help people from your own experience, you can invite the bot to any server and use it for yourself.

##Wyvern Hosting Support (Optional)
Additionally, all Wyvern Bot support representatives are offered the chance to also work for Wyvern Hosting, as both
companies currently have a very low ticket volume. More information about this opportunity can be found in the 
[Wyvern Hosting](https://discord.gg/UTmtWYMfae) discord, or the staff Discord if you are successful in your application.

* Agree to our [Terms of Service](../legal/tos.md)
* Active on Discord
* Friendly and easily approachable by customers
* Ability to work in a team

###Desirable

##Payment
This position is voluntary. However, if you take on a lead role or seriously impress us, you may be eligible for
non-monetary payment.
