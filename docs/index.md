!!! danger "Understanding the Documentation"
    We will provide command syntax throughout this documentation, it is crucial that you are able to understand it.

    ## Command Arguments
    Anything surrounded in <> or () are command arguments. These must be replaced with your own content.

    * <> = Required
    * () = Optional 
    
    ## Special Arguments
    Some arguments may not just be plain text. Here's two brief examples:

    * <#channel> = The hashtag means you need to mention the channel
    * <@role> = The @ also means mention
