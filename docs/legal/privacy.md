# Privacy Policy

When interacting with the bot, we may collect certain personally identifiable information that can be 
used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your discord tag
and ID.

Any personal information collected by Wyvern ("us", "we", "the bot", "our") will never be distributed to any third parties for any reason.

We reserve the right to modify this document along with any other legal document with our without an advance notice.

By using services provided by us, you agree to everything outlined in this document. If not, you must stop using our
services (or don't start). If you have previously used our services and disagree, please send a [deletion request](#data-requests)

##Data Collected

Whenever you interact with the bot or add it to a server, we collect some essential information to allow the bot to
function properly, and to tell us how our bot is being used. Additionally, if you ever request support from us, we may
use this data to provide you with more helpful information relating to your specific problem. 

Message content may be stored in cache for a very short period of time in order to fulfill any requests. If no request
that the bot needs to respond to is found, the content will be discarded very shortly afterwards. Unless an implicit
request that the bot needs to respond to is made, no information is stored.

When making a request to the bot, we may collect information on who and where the request is made, and details about
what is being requested. When using commands, this may include message content in the form of command arguments. 

##Data Retention
Data that is not stored for longer periods of time will be completely removed after each bot restart
or a cache sweep. You can use the uptime command to check how long the bot has been online for since the last
restart. Data that has been outlined above to be collected may be stored for up to 30 days. However, if any interactions
are found to violate any of our internal policies, the data is subject to be stored indefinitely. 
Additionally, non-personal data may be stored indefinitely (such as guild related information) as we have no way of
determining when the information will no longer be needed.

##Data Uses
* Fulfil requests made to the bot
* Provide us with information on how the bot and our related services are being used (analytics)
* Enforcing our [Terms of Service](tos.md)
* Providing you ("the user") with support (if requested)
* To detect, prevent and address technical issues

##Data Location
Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and exist on — computers located outside 
your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those 
from your jurisdiction. We cannot provide an exact location of where your data will always be stored.


##Data Requests
You have the right to access, amend and or request the removal of your personal information. Please get in
contact with us by opening a ticket on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/H2g5638vyD) if you have any queries
regarding data collection or wish to submit a request. Data that is essential to the functioning of the bot for other
users will not be deleted until the retention period is up.
